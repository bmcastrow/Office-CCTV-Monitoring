## üëÄ Project Overview
The CCTV-Office-Monitor project aims to classify and track employee behaviors in an office setting using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing office footage, the system detects actions like walking, sitting, talking, and falling to assess productivity, safety, and attendance patterns.
Since this project is part of a private group collaboration, only certain components covered in the article will be included in this repository.

### üöÄ Key Focus areas:

- ML: Scikit-learn (several classifiers)
- DL: ResNet18
- DL: Object Detection/Tracking (YOLOv8) 

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset, sourced from the University of Edinburgh, consists of **456,714 frames** collected from **four distinct office environments** (although only Office1(1-12 days) was considered in the project) over 20 days, capturing diverse employee behaviors. 

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Structure:
- **Resolution:** 1280x720 pixels (color images)
- **Class Labels:**
  - **Class 0**: Empty room
  - **Class 1**: Person standing/walking
  - **Class 2**: Person sitting
  - **Class 3**: Two or three people talking
  - **Class 4**: Person has fallen

## üß† Methodology

### üè∑Ô∏è 1. Traditional Machine Learning (Feature-Based Classification)
- **Features**: Extracted using **Img2Vec** (deep-learning vector representations) and **HOG** (shape-based gradients). These features are combined to enhance accuracy.
- **Models**: SVM, KNN, Decision Trees.., with **SVM** providing the best performance for behavior classification within the same office setting.
- **Goal**: Assess how well traditional ML can classify static behaviors based on engineered image features.

### ü§ñ 2. Deep Learning (ResNet-18)
- **Architecture**: ResNet-18, chosen for its effective handling of complex image patterns using residual connections (Good avoidance on vanashing gradients problem.)
- **Goal**: Evaluate deep learning‚Äôs capability for behavior recognition without extensive feature engineering.

### üì∏ 3. YOLOv8 Object Detection
- **Model**: YOLOv8, configured for real-time tracking of individuals with bounding boxes and behavior labels.
- **Goal**: Achieve real-time behavior tracking and assess model adaptability to different office environments.

## üìä Results & Analysis

### 1. Traditional Machine Learning (Feature-Based Classification)
- **Best Performance**: The **SVM** model using combined **Img2Vec + HOG** features provided the highest accuracy of **0.93** across same-office days, indicating that traditional ML models can be highly effective for behavior classification when using engineered features.
